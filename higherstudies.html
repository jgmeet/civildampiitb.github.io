          <h2> Time-Table</h2>
          <div style="text-align:justify;">One of the major concerns one has while applying graduate applications is what is the right time to start preparing for graduate admissions. The process is long and can be broken down into major milestones, such as giving GRE and TOEFL, choosing universities etc. Even though there is no fixed timeline, and you may choose to disagree, but below is a general timeline that most of the candidates follow and unless you have a very strong reason to delay any milestone we feel it may be helpful to stick  to.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><em><b>July/August:</b></em><b> </b>Fix a date for GRE and TOEFL for mid-September or early if possible. The earlier you decide it, the earlier and easier it would be for you to prepare for them. Preferably set the date a month in advance as it becomes difficult to find a free test center on weekend if you register 1-2 weeks before. In the meanwhile, discuss with your professors/friends/family regarding the universities you should apply for. Depending on your long-term objectives and past works the universities would vary for each student and the best way to get an admit is to align your interest and background with the university&#8217;s requirement. You are allowed to send 4 scores without any additional cost so it makes sense to send only to those you would ultimately apply for.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><em><b>September:</b></em><i><b> </b></i>Finish your tests and if you have scored less than what you expected don&#8217;t shy from giving it another shot. If you have already given the first test somewhere around 10th-14th September you can give another by October first week. Discuss with your Professors about your score and your chances in your university of choice with such a score.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><em><b>October: </b></em>Having decided on the universities and this would be a crucial phase for you, go through university websites and make a document mentioning important information like Deadlines, Fees, SOPs and recommendation requirements and any other relevant stuff.<br />
Once you have decided on the universities it is good to start filling in the forms as a major chunk of the questions are pretty standard and you would not have to worry about them later on. Plus this gives you an advantage in case some universities have any peculiar requirements. Pay close attention to the deadlines as some universities will have Dec 1st as the deadline and you may have to speed up things for them.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p><em><strong>End October/</strong><b>November: </b></em>We strongly suggest to start writing your SOPs when the month begins and have the first draft ready by the end of first week. This would be helpful in two ways</p>
<ul>
<li>It would give you enough time for reviews from professors and seniors so that you do not have to continuously nag them everyday.</li>
<li>This would also help you in approaching faculty for letters of recommendation. Faculty would generally ask for SOP and resume before starting the LOR. Your first draft would help them in deciding what to write and also remind them of finer points they may have forgotten.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact professors for letter of recommendations as early as possible. Generally give professors a month of time to write your letter. So it is ideal to have contacted and secured at least 3-4 faculty members by 15th November. Work on your SOP and other essay questions and finalize them by end of November</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>December: </strong></em>This is the crucial phase but if you have stuck to the timeline above it would be smooth sailing. Most of the universities have deadlines of 15th Dec, but it varies and some also have deadlines as 1st Dec. If you have filled most of the sections initially and are done with the LOR and SOP then it would only take 1 day for reviewing your application. Try to submit 2-3 days earlier as this gives you the opportunity to look for solutions in case a problem in payment comes up (Some Universities are specific about the type of card you pay with(eg. MasterCard only) and will not accept others).</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Once you are done with the submissions, sit back and relax. 🙂</div><br><br>

            <p>D-AMP stands for the Department Academic Mentorship Program. It comprises of two D-AMP Coordinators that oversee the program for the Civil Department and around thirty mentors. As the name suggests, we help students in their academic endeavours by providing them personal guidance and mentorship in order to smoothen their transition from freshmen year to sophomore year. As the D-AMP team, we always endeavour to go a step further and address the non academic and career related concerns of our mentees in order to provide a holistic mentorship experience.</p>
